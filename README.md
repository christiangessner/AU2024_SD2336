# SD2336 | Spit It Out: How AEC and the Manufacturing Data Model API Can Feed ERP Systems

## KEY LEARNING
- Learn how to extract product and quantity information from Revit data using the AEC Data Model API
- Learn how to extract bill of material information from Fusion CAD data using the Manufacturing Data Model API
- Explore the limitations and learn about possible workarounds to fully automate synchronizations

## DESCRIPTION
Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) or Fusion Team is used to store product data created with Revit, Fusion, Inventor or other Autodesk CAD authoring tools. The data stored in these cloud systems is often the most important intellectual property and is also critical for users who do not have access to Autodesk cloud-based systems. Learn how you can use Autodesk's AEC Data Model API and Manufacturing Data Model API to extract BOMs, product quantities and other critical metadata and publish it to ERP- or other enterprise-systems. Accurate, reliable and without manual data entry!
